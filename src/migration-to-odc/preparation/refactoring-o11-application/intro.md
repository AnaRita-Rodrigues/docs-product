# About refactoring O11 apps to be ODC compatible

As you plan and prepare your existing O11 app architecture to smoothly migrate to ODC at a later point, you must refactor and adjust your O11 implementation to ease the migration process. 

<div class="info" markdown="1">

The OutSystems Migration Toolkit will provide automation in the future to support some of the following refactorings. Until then, youâ€™ll have to manually refactor the app so that the migration is not blocked.

Here's some guidelines to refactor your O11 app:

* [Refactor anonymous and registered roles](refactor-anonymous-registered-roles.md)

* [Refactor public roles](refactor-public-roles.md)
* [Refactor public structures](refactor-public-structures.md)
* [Refactor system entities](refactor-systementities.md)
* [Refactor site properties](refactor-siteproperties.md)
