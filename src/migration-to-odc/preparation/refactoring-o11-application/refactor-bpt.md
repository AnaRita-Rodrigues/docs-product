# Refactor BPT to be ODC-compatible

<div class="info" markdown="1">

If you are only preparing your code for the migration, at present, OutSystems recommends not making any changes to O11 BPTs. OutSystems is working on migration automation capabilities to map existing O11 BPTs to ODC Workflows.

Business Process Technology (BPT) enables you to define and execute business processes within the applications. [BPT processes](https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/11/developing_an_application/use_processes_bpt/) are sequences of activities that build the workflow of a process, which is executed in the background. BPT is useful for implementing workflows that involve system-to-system or human-to-system interactions, and it allows for activities to run in parallel, providing flexibility in how business processes are managed and executed.
